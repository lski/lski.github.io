<div data-bind="fadeIn: true"><h2 class=block-header>About Me</h2><div class="block text-block"><p>Welcome! I'm Lee based in the UK and a long time full stack web application developer, just trying to give a little back to the community with articles and open source projects. I mostly working within the .Net stack but I also have experience in Node.js, PHP, plus other environments.</p><p>Strong believer in KISS and simple modularised code. These days its very important to keep our code bites small and single purpose as it allows for easy testing and bug fixing, it also makes it easier for other developers to pick due to its focused nature. This is applicable to any type of application, whether a traditional N-Tier model or CQRS on your back end or an SPA on the front end, anything.</p><p>I have listed some of my more recent skills and work based projects below in case you are interested.</p></div><div class=block><div><div class=tabs data-bind="tabs: true"><div class=tab-headers><div class="tab-header tab-selected" data-tabs-target=#tab-1>Skills</div><div class=tab-header data-tabs-target=#tab-2>Projects</div></div><div class="tab-content tab-selected" id=tab-1><div class=row><div class=col-sm-6><h4 class=header>Languages</h4><ul><li>C#</li><li>Javascript inclu.

This allowed the company to have several internal and external systems all tying their user control to one place, without external clients being aware of the transition to the SSO and back again.</dd><dt>Event Delegate Management System:</dt><dd>A system to manage delegates attending bespoke events for various large clients such as BMW, Volvo, Lundbeck, etc. With each client and each event having their own requirements, so very bespoke, the whole project was made of interchangeable components that could be dynamically added as desired. As well as a centralised back end management system, it also required completely bespoke web front ends designed for a particular event for delegates to use to register for that event. It also included a notification system and email system to enable communication with delegates.</dd><dt>Retail POS Mobile App:</dt><dd>An iOS/Android App that allowed the user to scan advertisements at point of sale to gain discounts at the retailer. It provided a geographic map for nearest deals available, along with a standard search, that when scanned verified the deal and the user against a server and used analytics (both google and bespoke) to provide the client with information about successful deals etc.</dd><dt>Company CMS:</dt><dd>Working in an internet media based company we created a company branded CMS system to allow clients to add and edit their websites but kept the price we offered to the clients low. It worked using an plugin overlay to work with place holders on template pages, where the user could drag and drop the items they wanted and set dates/times for them to become live.</dd><dt>Resource Booking System:</dt><dd>An NHS resource booking system, which included old browser support (IE6+) due to the client, while providing a visual method for booking resources and their dependencies in real time.</dd><dt>Insurance Claim Management:</dt><dd>A system for accepting a large flow of insurance repair jobs (over 1 million each week) and managing/creating relevant invoices. This involved interacting with various insurance companies, such as Admiral, NFU, Aviva, Hastings, etc in the data formats they desired, to a centralised admin system for our distributed company to be able to use. It also gave the administration staff all of the tools they needed to manage each request, whilst adhering to Data Protection laws and having strong security in place as we held details of millions of personal data of insurance company clients.</dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
